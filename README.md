Recipe Converter
===

Converts online recipes to a markdown format to be saved as a note.

I store all my recipes in [Joplin](git@github.com:BreD1810/recipe-converter.git), for access across all of my devices.
Other markdown editors are available.

## CLI Tool
To install from the repository:
```shell
make install-cli
```

To run:
```shell
convert-recipe <recipe-url>
```
